This data is gathered to gain a better understanding of the US population, and it plays into politics and society in that it provides the information the government needs to distribute funds to states and their localities. Data quality matters to form meaningful and accurate conclusions and fulfill the original intensions of learning to better fund the communities.  \n",

It asks the general information on identity without being too specific, but for future, large-scale surveys, it could have a space to describe gender identity to better reflect the diversity of the population. However, because there is so much room for improvement with the Census, I'm not entirely sure its practices could be adopted to gather richer and more useful data. Ensuring there is no representative bias when collecting data is likely the best way to maintain its quality and accuracy.\n",

When it comes to cleaning data, the concerns I have about protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, and race are that, as mentioned before, the way that someone identifies themselves is extremely personal and cannot be consolidated or \"cleaned\" like some of the variables above (i.e. with the shark data). Removing missing values would distinguish the full representation of the population, and adjusting missing values would skew the data and add bias. These are just a few practices that will do more harm than good, and it is important to have high quality data, especially when representating real people.\n",
